Case
====

These are the files you'll need for 3d printing the case and/or modifying it as you desire.

Case for thermo-stat.f3z
------------------------

This is the fusion 360 archive that you *should* be able to just re-import and edit. I have no idea if it'll actually work for anyone else. Open an issue if you have... issues.

Case for thermo-stat.stp
------------------------

A step file that should be more widely accessible to folks wanting to modify this design


thermostats_top.stl / thermostats_bottom.stl
--------------------------------------------

Ready to print STL files. The top needs to be flipped over, so the face is on the build plate and it grows upwards from there. Intended to print at 0.15mm layer height, and the countersunk screw holes on the top will have the hole covered with a bridge. I found poking through the bridge with a hex wrench (that I'd use for the screws) and then deburring both sides with a phillips screwdriver worked well.
